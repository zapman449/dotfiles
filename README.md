dotfiles
========

dotfiles, refactored to use `stow`

`brew install stow` to get started, presuming a mac (though most everything here should work the same on linux)

Other brew formulas:

```
brew install bat ca-certificates coreutils fd findutils fzf gawk gnu-sed gnu-tar neovim powerlevel10k readline \
             shellcheck stow tree-sitter zsh-syntax-highlighting wezterm
```
